# SysTest

SysTest is a lightweight library supporting the Erlang/OTP Common Test
Framework. The primary goal for this project is to simplify writing
tests that exercise distributed (multi-node) applications, assisting
the test author in some of the following tasks:

# starting and stopping local and/or remote nodes
# performing activities on a *group* of nodes
# monitoring the state of a *group* of nodes
# reacting to changes in a *group* of nodes
# scripting activities to take place to nodes

SysTest is distributed under a permissive, BSD-like license.
